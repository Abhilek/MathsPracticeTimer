This timer was made to practice Quantitative aptitude problems within a time limit.
There are two variables that control the time set for two buttons. The default vales are 40 seconds and 60 seconds.
Two timers run independently.
A buzzer sets off when time is over.
If a button is pressed while timer is runnning, it reset the timer and count again till overflow.
